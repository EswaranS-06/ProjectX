# Cybersecurity SIEM Project with Unknown Metrics, ML, AI, and NLP  
## Documentation

***

## 1. Project Overview  
This project aims to build an advanced Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool that integrates machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and natural language processing (NLP) to detect both known and unknown cyber threats and anomalies. The key focus is on incorporating **unknown metrics** to effectively measure the system’s ability to identify novel attack patterns, zero-day exploits, and emerging anomalies that traditional signature-based systems might miss.

***

## 2. Objectives  
- Collect and process diverse cybersecurity log data from multiple sources.  
- Use ML and NLP models to identify unknown and anomalous threats.  
- Implement unknown metrics such as unknown threat detection rate, false positive rate on unknowns, mean time to detect (MTTD), and detection confidence.  
- Provide visualization dashboards for real-time monitoring, alerting, and analyst feedback.  
- Establish continuous learning loops for system improvement and adaptability.

***

## 3. Data Sources  
The tool ingests logs and telemetry from:  
- Network Devices (Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Routers)  
- Endpoints (EDR logs, OS logs)  
- Authentication Systems (Active Directory, MFA logs)  
- Cloud and SaaS services (AWS CloudTrail, Azure logs)  
- Threat Intelligence Feeds  
- Application & API logs  

***

## 4. Technical Solution Components  

### 4.1 Data Ingestion and Preprocessing  
- Raw logs collected via Syslog, APIs, agents, or streams (e.g., Kafka).  
- Parsing and normalization into a structured schema (CEF, JSON).  
- Data cleaning, deduplication, time-synchronization applied.  
- Enrichment with contextual data: GeoIP, WHOIS, asset info, threat intel matches.  
- Feature engineering: sliding window stats, counts, ratios, NLP embeddings for textual logs.

### 4.2 ML & NLP Model Development  
- **Unsupervised anomaly detection:** Isolation Forest, ECOD, One-Class SVM for unknown anomaly detection.  
- **NLP Modules:** Transformer embeddings (SBERT), zero-shot classification to analyze free-text logs and alerts.  
- **Hybrid Detection:** Combine supervised classifiers for known attacks with unsupervised models for unknowns.

### 4.3 Unknown Metrics Integration  
- Unknown Threat Detection Rate: Measure detection efficacy on novel threats.  
- False Positive Rate on Unknowns: Quantify alert noise in new/unseen conditions.  
- Mean Time To Detect (MTTD): Measure detection speed for unknown threats.  
- Confidence Scores: Quantify model uncertainty.  
- Drift and Stability Tracking: Monitor data distribution shifts affecting detection.

### 4.4 Detection Pipeline and Alerting  
- Batch and real-time scoring pipelines filter and score incoming data streams.  
- Dynamic thresholding based on statistical models (EWMA, quantiles).  
- Correlation and kill-chain mapping link related alerts into incidents.  
- Alerts prioritized, deduplicated, and pushed to SOC analyst dashboards.

### 4.5 Visualization and Feedback  
- Real-time dashboards built using Streamlit or Dash:  
  - Anomaly score heatmaps  
  - Alert timelines and severity graphs  
  - Entity relationship/graph visualizations  
- Analyst feedback incorporated to label alerts and retrain models.  
- Continuous learning cycle for active/semi-supervised updates.

## 5. Implementation Example (only example) (Python Snippet)  
```python
from pyod.models.ecod import ECOD
import pandas as pd

# Load and preprocess logs (feature engineering + NLP embeddings)
df = pd.read_csv("processed_logs.csv")
features = df.drop(columns=["label", "message"])

# Train anomaly detection model
model = ECOD()
model.fit(features)

# Predict anomalies and calculate metrics
scores = model.decision_function(features)
alerts = scores > 0.5  # example threshold

# Calculate unknown detection rate on rare anomaly labels
def calculate_detection_rate(labels, alerts):
    true_positives = (labels == 1) & (alerts == True)
    return true_positives.sum() / labels.sum()

detection_rate = calculate_detection_rate(df["label"], alerts)
print(f"Unknown Threat Detection Rate: {detection_rate:.2f}")
```

## 6. Project Flowchart  
A detailed pipeline includes:  
- Data ingestion → Parsing & Enrichment → Feature Engineering → ML/NLP modeling → Scoring & Unknown Metrics calculation → Alerting → Visualization → Analyst Feedback → Continuous Improvement  
(Refer to the detailed flowchart provided).

***

## 7. Challenges and Considerations  
- Data quality and completeness impact detection accuracy.  
- Balancing false positives and unknown threat detection is critical.  
- Continuous model retraining required to adapt to evolving threats and concept drift.  
- Explainability of unknown anomaly alerts important for SOC workflows.  
- Security and compliance of the SIEM platform and data storage.

***

## 8. Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate streaming ML models for real-time adaptation.  
- Enhance NLP modules for richer understanding of unstructured logs and threat reports.  
- Integrate advanced SIEM correlation and playbook automation.  
- Plug into external threat intelligence and vulnerability feeds dynamically.
